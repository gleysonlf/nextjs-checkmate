## Project Architecture

### Folder structure for Next JS 14

- **Components** - This is self-explanatory;
- **Config** -
  Here is very simple, just store any config file;
- **Constants** - Another useful folder to have to have all your constants in one place;
- **Context** - Store your react context files;
- **DB** - Store your database-related files;
- **Hooks** - Store your custom react hooks;
- **Server actions** - Next JS allows us to have functions that we can call from the client components that run on the server by using the 'use server' string on top of a function. A good to organize those functions is by creating a server-actions folder;
- **Models/Types** - If you are using Typescript having a types folder is very useful for having your types easily accessible;
- **Vendor** - Here you would store code that calls 3rd parties services.

That's it from me
